    "** Introduction **\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Anaconda Navigator</u>  \n",
    "Anaconda Navigator is a user-friendly interface for running Anaconda. Anaconda is used to create environments for Python programming easily. Enviroment are a set of programs (packages) that are bundled into one folder. When you create a Python environment in Anaconda, it will automatically download and install some programs including Python interpreter (python.exe) and Conda. Conda is a package manager: a program to make sure there is no clash between packages installed in the same environment. Conda can be used to install more packages into an environment. This concept is illustrated in Fig.1.  \n",

    "![Fig.1. Anaconda environment](Fig1.JPG)  \n",
    "Fig. 1. Anaconda environment. Each environment contains programs (packages) independent of the other environments.  \n",

    "<u>VSCode</u>  \n",
    "VSCode is an enhanced text editor. Unlike plain text editor such as Notepad, we can install an extension to make VSCode to be smarter. Example of these extensions are Python and Jupyter which we installed in Tutorial 1.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Python</u>  \n",
    "The Python extension of VSCode allows VSCode to \"understand\" some parts of Python language (for example, it can mark Python keywords with different color). It also allows VSCode to call python.exe (the interpreter of Python language). However, to do this, we have to tell VSCode where to find this interpreter (by pressing Ctrl+Shift+P and then choose the \"Python: Select Interpreter\" command).\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Jupyter Notebook</u>  \n",
    "The Jupyter extension of VSCode allows VSCode to open and understand Jupyter Notebook. Jupyter Notebook can be thought as an interactive interface to the Python interpreter (python.exe). The code and the output of the code are shown cell by cell in the same screen (code-output-code-output-...). Note that the Python interpreter used by the Jupyter Notebook can be different than the one set by the Python extension.\n",
